                    <h2 class="mb-4">Our Story</h2>
                    <p class="lead">Coffee Party was born from a simple idea: bringing people together through exceptional coffee experiences. What started as a small passion project in 2020 has grown into one of Sweden's most trusted coffee delivery and event services.</p>
                    <p>We began by hosting intimate coffee tastings in Stockholm cafés, sharing our knowledge and enthusiasm with small groups of coffee lovers. The response was overwhelming, and soon businesses started asking us to bring the experience to their offices. Today, we serve hundreds of companies and individuals across Sweden, delivering not just coffee, but moments of connection and discovery.</p>
                    <p>Our journey has taught us that coffee is more than just a beverage—it's a catalyst for conversation, creativity, and community. Every bean we source, every machine we deliver, and every event we host is designed with this philosophy in mind. We work directly with sustainable coffee farms in Ethiopia, Colombia, Brazil, Guatemala, and Indonesia, ensuring fair trade practices and exceptional quality at every step.</p>

                    <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Our Mission</h3>
                    <p>Our mission is to make world-class coffee accessible to everyone, whether you're a multinational corporation or hosting friends at home. We believe that great coffee shouldn't require a trip to an expensive café—it should be part of your daily routine. By providing premium equipment, expertly roasted beans, and educational experiences, we empower people to become their own baristas.</p>

                    <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">Our Vision</h3>
                    <p>We envision a future where every workplace and home in Sweden has access to exceptional coffee. We're expanding our services to include barista training programs, subscription services with personalized bean recommendations, and virtual coffee tastings. Our commitment to sustainability drives us to reduce packaging waste, support carbon-neutral shipping, and invest in renewable coffee farming practices. Together with our partners and customers, we're building a more sustainable and delicious coffee culture.</p>
